## Abstract  

The purpose of this project is to examine the impact of COVID19 on the rental market of the five boroughs of New York City(NYC). Our findings indicate that COVID19 has impacted the median asking price of rentals in all boroughs as well as the availability of rental units. We used pie charts, scatter plots, and line graphs to show the median rent asking prices and the number of units available before and after COVID19. We've also calculated the minimun and maximum values for median rent and availability of units which shows the  According to our data set, Manhattan has been most affected by COVID19 and Staten Island has been least affected. COVID19 has destabalized the expected median asking price of rental units in the five boroughs with asking prices exceeding what the expected trajectory predicted. We also see that the inventory of available units in the five boroughs has decreased, which is opposite of the expected trajectory.  

This data shows how COVID19 has affected the real estate industry for renters in NYC. With our data sets, we have found that the median rental price for units will continue to climb quickly. For rental inventory, we can see that the amount of units available will also continue to increase, but the data suggests that number will increase at a slower rate compared to the rate of median pricing increase. Other factors that may impact the median price of rent and unit availablility are the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet, and location of these properties. Some extra data would give us a better understanding of the expected trends moving forward.
